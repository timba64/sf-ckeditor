CKEditor work fine in EasyAdmin

now i try to implement CKFinder (ckfinder-symfony-bundle - 3.5.1.5) in Symfony 5.1

I followed by this Article https://medium.com/suleyman-aydoslu/implementing-ckeditor-and-ckfinder-on-easyadmin-a269888771ce
but it isn't help me.

In https://github.com/ckfinder/ckfinder-symfony-bundle i read that we should insert the Main CKFinder JavaScript File in Templates
 but how could i make this ??
I don't see ckfinder.js on the page.

## no decision here

So I try to use FMELfinderBundle.
